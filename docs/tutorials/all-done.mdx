That's all for the frourio tutorial.

We didn't dare to mention it, frourio also has a setup tool named [create-frourio-app](/docs/reference/cfa/gui).

Also, there is a lot of information in the [Docs](/docs) that is not covered in the tutorial.
Please read it as well to get a better understanding of frourio.
