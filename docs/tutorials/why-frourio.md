## What is Frourio? {#what-is-frourio}

Frourio is a CLI tool that allows TypeScript static type checking between client-side and server-side. It generates bridging files and enables type-based development.

For the client side and server side, any combination of the frameworks supported by Frourio can be built.

## Why Frourio? {#why-frourio}

Even though we were developing the client-side and server-side in TypeScript, it was difficult to statically type-check the API requests between them.

So we were forced to write **"Two TypeScript"** . And we have spent a lot of time testing with those browsers and servers.

But with Frourio, they can be statically connected by type, greatly improving the development experience with **"One TypeScript"** .
