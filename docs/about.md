## What is Frourio? {#what-is-frourio}

Frourio is a CLI tool that enables static type checking by Typescript for communication between client-side and server-side. It generates bridging files and thus it provides you type-based development.

It is easy to build with any combinations of the client side and the server side frameworks supported by Frourio.

## Why Frourio? {#why-frourio}

Even though we were developing both the client-side and server-side application in TypeScript, it is hard to program the API requests between them type-safe.

So we were forced to write TypeScript "twice".
And we have spent a lot of time testing with those browsers and servers.

But with Frourio, they can be "connected" by type.
Frourio improves greatly the development experience with "connected" TypeScript.
